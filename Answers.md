1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Ans. Server-side routing is when something like a like button is clicked on       a page and the URL changes taking them to a new page. This causes the        whole page to refresh.  A new Get request is sent to the server and          sends back a new page, discarding the old page.

    Client-side routing happens when a route is handled by JavaScript internally, that causes the page to load. The request to the server is prevented when a user clicks on a link. This causes a change of state to the application. The webpage will look different, but it may be just one element has changed or some data has been added. The whole page does not refresh.
